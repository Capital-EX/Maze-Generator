![Example of 100 x 100 Maze](/imgs/example.png)

Saw an example of a maze generator using Prim's Algorithm on 
Wikipedia.  I thought it would be fun to make an implementation myself.
This implementation makes usage of a min-heap to store costs. 

The generator is rather slow on large graphs, but it's better
than the first one I had!  The first one was slow *and* used ***gigabytes*** of RAM.

I added some.
